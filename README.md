Teapot-Saga-IV
==============

In the next epic instalment to the Teapot Saga (trademark pending), take control of [playername], an adventurer destined to help
the Rebellion and save the world from the Teapocalypse, a cataclysmic, world-changing event instigated by Joe Soap, Avatar of the
Teanity. In a game somewhat similar to certain Roguelikes (minus the random generation in the main game), save the world from the
horrors of Tea.
Just remember, Fate dictates everything.
